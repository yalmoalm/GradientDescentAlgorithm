# ****Linear Regression Gradient Descent****

This script implements linear regression using the gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal parameters that minimize the loss function. It generates random data points, initializes parameters, defines the learning rate, and performs iterative updates to find the best-fitted line.

****Initialization****

The script begins by initializing some parameters. It generates a random array x of shape (10, 1) and computes the corresponding y values using the equation y = 2*x + random_noise. The parameters w and b are set to initial values of 0.0.

****Hyperparameter****

A hyperparameter, learning_rate, is defined to control the step size of the gradient descent algorithm. It determines how quickly the algorithm converges to the optimal solution. You can adjust this value to achieve better convergence or prevent overshooting.

****Gradient Descent Function****

The script defines a function named descend(x, y, w, b, learning_rate) to perform the gradient descent update on the parameters w and b. It computes the gradients dldw and dldb by iterating over the data points and applying the derivative of the loss function. The parameters are then updated using the learning rate and the average of the gradients over the dataset.

****Iterative Updates****

The script performs iterative updates using a for loop that runs for a specified number of epochs (in this case, 10,000). In each epoch, the descend function is called to update the parameters w and b. The predicted values yhat are computed using the updated parameters. The loss function is calculated as the mean squared error between the true y values and the predicted yhat values. The current epoch number, loss, and updated parameters are printed.
